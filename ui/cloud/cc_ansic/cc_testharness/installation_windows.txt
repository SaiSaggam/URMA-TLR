**** Get and Setup the TestHarness for Cloud Connector for Java
7º Clone the TestHarness repository from Git/Stash:	
	Create root directory "C:\CC4J\"
	Clone TestHarness inside this directory with "git clone https://xxxxxxxxx@stash.digi.com/scm/cc/cc_testharness.git"
	

8º Create the Python environment with all needed packages:	
	Go to "C:\CC4J\cc_testHarness\python"
	Execute "C:\CC4J\cc_testharness\python> python bootstrap"
	Finally execute "C:\CC4J\cc_testharness\python> bin\buildout.exe install"


9º Execute TestHarness Validation:	
	Go to "C:\CC4J\cc_testHarness\"
	Execute "C:\CC4J\cc_testharness> python\bin\python.exe cc_test.py --platform java --help"



**** Get a SSH key and setup Git/Stash to use it
10º Create a new SSH RSA key:
	Go to "C:\Users\sa\.ssh"
	Execute the following command line: "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\ssh-keygen" -t rsa -C "XXXXXX.XXXXXX@digi.com"
		C:\Users\sa\.ssh>"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\ssh-keygen" -t rsa -C "Arturo.Buzarra@digi.com"
		Generating public/private rsa key pair.
		Enter file in which to save the key (//.ssh/id_rsa): C:\Users\sa\.ssh\id_rsa
		Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
		Enter same passphrase again:
		Your identification has been saved in C:\Users\sa\.ssh\id_rsa.
		Your public key has been saved in C:\Users\sa\.ssh\id_rsa.pub.
		The key fingerprint is:
			XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:........:XX XXXXXX.XXXXXX@digi.com

11º Obtain the public key to upload to Git/Stash:
	Go to "C:\Users\sa\.ssh"
	Execute the following command line: "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\ssh-keygen" -y
	Enter file in which the key is (//.ssh/id_rsa): C:\Users\sa\.ssh\id_rsa
	Enter passphrase:
	ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC.......................EsgQ==
	
12º Go to Git/Stash and paste the "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC.......................EsgQ==" key




WARNING!! if CC4J does not works fine try the following steps:
- Install manually the pywin32 library for python from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/
- Install with "easy_install pywin32"
- Install with "easy_install winpexpect"
- Use the egg file for pywin32
