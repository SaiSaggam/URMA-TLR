#=NAME swap
#=DESCRIPTION 
# Confined processes are prohibited from executing certain system calls 
# entirely, including swapon(2) swapoff (2).  This test verifies that 
# unconfined processes can call these syscalls but confined processes cannot.
#=END

# I made this a seperate test script because of the need to make a
# swapfile before the tests run.
