The apparmor_parser allows you to add, replace, and remove AppArmor
policy through the use of command line options. The default is to add.
`apparmor_parser --help` shows what the command line options are.

You can also find more information at
<http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?apparmor>.

Please send all complaints, bug reports, feature requests, rants about the
software, and questions to apparmor-general@forge.novell.com. Security
issues should be directed to security@suse.de or secure@novell.com,
where we will attempt to conform to the RFP vulnerability disclosure
protocol: http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/policy.html

Thanks.
