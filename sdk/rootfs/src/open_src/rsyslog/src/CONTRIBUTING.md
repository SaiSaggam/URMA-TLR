How to Contribute
=================
Rsyslog is a real open source project and open to contributions.
By contributing, you help improve the state of logging as well as improve
your own professional profile. Contributing is easy, and there are options
for everyone - you do not need to be a developer.

These are many ways to contribute to the project:
 * become a rsyslog ambassador and let other people know about rsyslog and how to utilize it for best results. Help rsyslog getting backlinks, be present on Internet news sites or at meetings you attend.
 * help others by offering support on
   * the rsyslog forums at http://kb.monitorware.com/rsyslog-f40.html
   * the rsyslog mailing list at http://lists.adiscon.net/mailman/listinfo/rsyslog
 * help with the documentation; you can either contribute
   * to the [rsyslog doc directory](https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/tree/master/doc), which is shown on http://rsyslog.com/doc
   * to the rsyslog project web site -- just ask us for account creation
   * on the rsyslog wiki at http://wiki.rsyslog.com/
 * become a bug-hunter and help with testing rsyslog development releases
 * help driving the rsyslog infrastructure with its web sites, wikis and the like
 * help creating packages
 * or, obviously, help with rsyslog code development

This list is not conclusive. There for sure are many more ways to contribute and if you find one, just let us know. We are very open to new suggestions and like to try out new things.
